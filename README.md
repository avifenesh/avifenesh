## Current Exploration

Beyond my work on Valkey and Glide, I‚Äôm investing in **kernel programming (C & Rust)** through a structured set of learning sprints. The focus is a **kernel-accelerated data/Vector-Search engine**, with performance optimization using **ARM NEON SIMD**.

**Key areas of exploration**

* Core memory management (allocators, memory pressure handling, slab/ring-buffer designs)
* Storage structures (hash indexing, B-tree variants, fixed-size embeddings)
* System interface (character device `/dev/vss` with IOCTL for user-space integration)
* Performance optimization (SIMD-accelerated distance/similarity ops on ARM)
* Rust user-space client to interact with the kernel device

This is **exploration and prototyping** work ‚Äî reflecting a long-term interest in combining databases, optimization, and kernel-level programming.
